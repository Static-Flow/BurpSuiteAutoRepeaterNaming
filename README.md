# BurpSuiteAutoRepeaterNaming
This extension replaces the default repeater tab name with the URL path of the repeater request.

By default Burp Suite names repeater tabs sequencial numbers, 1,2,3...etc. This extension replaces that behavior by changing the repeater tab title to the URL path of the repeater request.
